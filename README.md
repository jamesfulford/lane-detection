Overview
---

First project completed for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.


The Project
---

My Python3 code is in the Jupyter Notebook. You can see it run in your browser by running this command in terminal:

`jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.

Input files can be found in the `test_images` and `test_videos` directories. Output from my code can be found in the `test_images_output` and `test_videos_output` directories.

The write-up for this project can be found in `WRITEUP.md`.
